<h1><b>Dragon Cave</b></h1>
<p>As you walk along the path to the cave, the trail gets rougher and you see the bones of wild animals lying around. Some of the trees look schorched, several more recently than others. A rusty-but-still-intact sword is lying on the ground. After hearing a low growl, you pick it up. You keep walking along and hold the sword tight.</p>
