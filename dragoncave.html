<h1><b>Dragon Cave</b></h1>
<p>As you walk along the path to the cave, the trail gets rougher and you see the bones of wild animals lying around. Some of the trees look schorched, several more recently than others. A rusty-but-still-intact sword is lying on the ground. After hearing a low growl, you pick it up. You keep walking along and hold the sword tight. Suddenly, a pack of large wolves come in behind you. There are too many for you to fight off with a sword, so you run in the direction of the dragon cave. Once you are almost there, the wolves stop and scurry back into the woods. Looking at the cave, you see two openings. They are both dark and you cant see inside, but the one on the right is wet and ranks of dead meat. The wolves are still at the edge of the forest, so you can't go back. You must choose an opening.</p>
