    <p>You. You come to a fork in the road. There are three seperate paths. One has a sign on it that says Hontown, the middle has a sign that says Dragon Cave, and the left one has a sign that says continuing forest. You are not tired or hungry yet, but your food storage will only last for one day. Which path will you choose?</p>
