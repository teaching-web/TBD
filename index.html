    <p>You have gotton lost from a hiking group in a dark forest. The occurence to  wait and be found never comes to you and you keep walking along an old path. All you have with you is a watch, three quarters, a pencil stub, and an old paper. You come to a fork in the road. There are three seperate paths. One has a sign on it that says Smalltown, the middle has a sign that says Dragon Cave, and the left one has a sign that says Continuing Forest. You are not tired or hungry yet, but you have no food and very little money. Which path will you choose?</p>
