    <body><h1><b>The Native Camp</b></h1>
<p>You try to stand up, but pain shoots through your head and you slump back to the ground. The girl goes on one side of you and the boy goes on the other side and they help you up. They support you as they take you deeper into the forest, away from the path. The boy points to himself and says, "Zaleb." The girl points to herself and says, "D'ahna." You tell them your name. They take you to a large open area. People start jumping out of the trees. They all bow to a tall man with a hostile face and a feather headress. Zaleb and D'ahna start talking to him in their language. He shouts at them and looks angry, although he has looked angry since he jumped down from his tree. Zaleb and D'ahna look at you with apologetic faces and step into the crowd. Four masked people dressed in black come out and start circling you and chanting. They take out knives that look like they're charged with electricity. suddenly they charge on you and stab you/electricute you to death.</p>
