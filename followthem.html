    <body><h1><b>The Native Camp</b></h1>
<p>You try to stand up, but pain shoots through your head and you slump back to the ground. The girl goes on one side of you and the boy goes on the other side and they help you up. They support you as they take you deeper into the forest, away from the path. The boy points to himself and says, "Zaleb." The girl points to herself and says, "D'ahna." You tell them your name.</p>
