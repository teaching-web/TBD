<p>You arrive in the town. It is small and quiet and a few people are walking around. There is a a sign above a store that says General Store. You have enough provisions for the day and no money, so you don't go in. A little farther down the street, an inn says 5 coins a night. There is a poster on the bulliten board in front of the inn that says: 
<b>1,000 coin reward to the one who kills the Dragon!</b>
You need the money if you are going to rent a room to sleep in. </html>
