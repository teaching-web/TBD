  <b>Smalltown</b>
</h1>
<p>You arrive in the town. It is small and quiet and a few people are walking around. They are all in old-fashioned clothing and when you pass by, some stare and whisper. There is a a sign above a building that says General Store. You go in and look around. Nothing looks modern or familiar. When you ask what you can get for 3 quarters, the man at the counter asks, "What's a quarter?" You show him one of your quarters and he says, "Oh, you mean a tin coin. Three of those will get you a peck of wheat." Since you wouldn't know what to do with a bushel of wheat, you deny and leave the store. A little farther down the street, an inn says 5 silver coins or one gold coin a night. There is a poster on the bulliten board in front of the inn that says: 
<p><b>1,000 silver coin reward to the one who kills the Dragon!</b></p>
<p>You need the money if you are going to rent a room to sleep in and get food to eat, but you don't have any tools for killing a dragon. You look at the bulliten board some more and see a poster that says:</p>
<p><b>Lost: Three Pigs. Missing From Peterson's Farm. Last Seen Running Into The Dark Forest Towards The Dragon. Reward: 5 Silver coins.</b></p>
<p>If you return the pigs, you will have enough money to rent a room at the inn.</p>
