<h1>
  <b>Smalltown</b>
</h1>
<p>You arrive in the town. It is small and quiet and a few people are walking around. There is a a sign above a store that says General Store. You have no money, so you don't go in. A little farther down the street, an inn says 5 coins a night. There is a poster on the bulliten board in front of the inn that says: 
<p><b>1,000 coin reward to the one who kills the Dragon!</b></p>
<p>You need the money if you are going to rent a room to sleep in, but you don't have any tools for killing a dragon.</p></html>
