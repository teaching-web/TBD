    <h1><b> Adventure</b></h1>
    <p>You are a warrior on a journey through an unknown forest. Your only tools are a sword, a bow with a quiver of arrows, a knife, and a few minor provisions. You come to a fork in the road. There are three seperate paths. One has a sign on it that says Hontown, the middle has a sign that says Dragon Cave, and the left one has a sign that says continuing forest. You are not yet tired or hungry, but your food storage will only last for one day. Which path will you choose.
