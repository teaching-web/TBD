<h1><b>Continuing Forest</b></h1>
<p>You continue on deeper into the forest. The trees cast cheerful shadows on the ground and the plants are still wet with morning dew. You check your watch. It says 8:32 a.m. As you walk along, you feel like you are being watched, but there isn't the slightest notification that there is any human but you in the forest.</p>
