<h1><b>Continuing Forest</b></h1>
<p>You continue on deeper into the forest. The trees cast cheerful shadows on the ground and the plants are still wet with morning dew. You check your watch. It says 8:32 a.m. As you walk along, you feel like you are being watched, but there isn't the slightest notification that there is any human but you in the forest. Suddenly, a large tree branch falls on your head and you are knocked out. When you wake up, you are no longer on the path. You are lying on the ground and a boy and a girl are standing above you. They are wearing simple clothing made out of animal hides, and the girl has a strange rock on a string around her neck. The boy speaks to you, but you don't understand his language. When you give them a confused look, they start talking to each other rapidly. You sit up and check your watch. It says 8:33, although it seems like it should have been at least an hour since you got knocked out. You look up to see the girl gesturing for you to follow her. You don't know if you can trust them, but the two are the only ones who can help you.</p>
