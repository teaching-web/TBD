<h1><b>The Left Opening</b></h1>
<p>You step cautiously into the left cave. Your watch has a light on it and you turn it on. The cave sparkles with diamonds and there is no sign of a dragon. Most are buried too deep to dig out, but you are able to pull out a small diamond and you put it in your pocket. You hear squeals and follow the sound to a large pit inside the cave. Inside the pit are 7 pigs. The pit is not deep and you are able to pull the pigs out. There is an opening at the back of the cave which you go out of and you walk a little farther, driving the pigs in  front of you. Soon you come to the crossroads again and go down the Smalltown road. You search around to see who might own the pigs and end up leaving them with the owner of the inn which has a wanted poster for 7 pigs.</p>
