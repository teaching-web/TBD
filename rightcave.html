      <h1><b>The Right Opening</b></h1>
      <p> You go into the cave and immediately hold your hand over your nose and mouth. The stench inside the cave is suffocating. There are bones lying everywhere and coins are in neat piles around the wall. A shiny new sword is leaning against the wall so you take the rusty sword you're holding and replace it with the new one. Suddenly a huge purple dragon leaps out from the shadows and starts roaring at you. The last thing you see is five sets of shiny lavender teeth surrounding a huge ball of fire before you die. </p>
